# BusinessEntityLara
Scrapes all businesses in the state of Michigan as registered with LARA. 

Basically this takes a list of all the IDs pertaining to business records displayed by Lara's Business Entity Search page. https://cofs.lara.state.mi.us/CorpWeb/CorpSearch/CorpSearch.aspx

From this list of IDs, we can discern basic information about Michigan businesses. 

Things I would like to add:

Doing Business as information
Other Filings
links to location or NAICS information

Things to do:

create callable objects to use based on pages observed. Choose whether or not to use selenium.

Save & Read HTML locally to speed parsing.

pull links to tif images.

formally adopt fields to pull on main page.
